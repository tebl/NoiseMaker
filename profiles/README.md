# 1> Profiles
The *NoiseMaker* simply plays audio files using a cheaply available module for Arduino, oftenly referred to as the *DFPlayer Mini* though the name *MP3-tf-16p* will probably be more correct. The Arduino sketch included as part of the *NoiseMaker* refers to different sets of audio files as *"profiles"* - the contents of the subdirectory called "sdcard" must be copied onto the SD-card used.

While I hope to make my own recordings to match my own hardware, a few profiles have been created using resources found online. As such they have their own terms for usage and so this file should include all of the information needed to comply with the license that they have been made available under. If you find something to be missing, let me know and I'll endevour to either update or have those specific files removed.

Modified versions of Amiga floppy drive sounds, the original audio files have been up for download as part of the [WinUAE](https://www.winuae.net/download/) installation.

# Old HDDs
User [Klerpp](https://freesound.org/people/Klerrp/) on freesound has created a pack of recordings of [old HDDs](https://freesound.org/people/Klerrp/packs/8850/?page=3#sound), this profile has been created with those recordings as a starting point. The files have been tweaked for length, volume and separated into separate files depending on what the HDD was doing at the time.

The files have been release under a [CC0 1.0-license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), requiring no specific licensing steps beyond specifying that they come with no warranty of any kind - neither from its original creator or the NoiseMaker project.
